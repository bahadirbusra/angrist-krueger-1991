## Motivation

* Understanding & implementing workflows is hard
* We provide a guide to one alternative, 'Snakemake'

* Practical Example: Replicating Angrist and Krueger's 1991 paper that uses quarter of birth as an instrument for education

## Another slide

* Bullets
    - Sub bullets
    - *italic*
    - **bold**

1. Numbered Lists ...
2. Can go like this

## Motivating Evidence of First Stage Regression

```{r fig-sub, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Graphical depiction of first stage and reduced form for IV estimates of the economic return to schooling using quarter of birth', fig.subcap = c('Subcaption1', 'Subcaption2'), fig.show = "hold", out.width = '.50\\linewidth', fig.asp = 1, fig.ncol = 2}
knitr::include_graphics( c("../../out/figures/education_by_cohort.pdf",
                            "../../out/figures/earnings_by_cohort.pdf"))
```
